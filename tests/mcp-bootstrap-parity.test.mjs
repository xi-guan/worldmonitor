// U7 (Tier 3) — MCP parity test. Asserts that every canonical seeded cache key
// in `api/health.js::BOOTSTRAP_KEYS` ∪ `STANDALONE_KEYS` is either:
//   (a) covered by some `TOOL_REGISTRY[i]._cacheKeys` array (CacheToolDef), OR
//   (b) covered by some `TOOL_REGISTRY[i]._coverageKeys` array (RpcToolDef hybrid), OR
//   (c) listed in `EXCLUDED_FROM_MCP` below with a non-empty documented reason.
//
// Fail-hard: a new seed shipping its cache key into BOOTSTRAP_KEYS/STANDALONE_KEYS
// without a corresponding MCP tool will fail CI until the contributor adds a tool
// or adds an EXCLUDED_FROM_MCP entry with a reason. This is the structural fix
// preventing future drift between the canonical seeded-data inventory and the
// MCP tool registry.
