// ============================================================================
// CII / Strategic Risk — editorial coefficients
// ============================================================================
//
// These constants drive the published Composite Instability Index (CII) and
// Strategic Risk roll-up scores. They are EDITORIAL WEIGHTS authored by the
// WorldMonitor intelligence team — NOT derived from a published academic
// index, peer-reviewed paper, or external risk product. Treat them as
// opinionated, not empirical.
//
// Change protocol:
//   1. Bump CII_FORMULA_VERSION below.
//   2. Update docs/methodology/cii-risk-scores.mdx (the public methodology
//      note) in the same commit. Tests assert the doc lists every coefficient
//      and every CURATED_COUNTRIES code.
//   3. Note the change in docs/changelog.mdx and CHANGELOG.md under the
//      public-facing section so downstream users of the proto API see why score
//      values or movement semantics may shift between deploys.
//
// Last reviewed: 2026-06-06 (attribution and climate-consumer fixes, v7).
