## How to Run

```bash
npm ci                   # Deterministic install (also runs blog-site postinstall)
npm run dev              # Start Vite dev server (full variant)
npm run dev:tech         # Start tech-only variant
npm run dev:energy       # Start energy-security variant
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit (strict mode)
npm run typecheck:api    # Typecheck API layer separately
npm run test:data        # Run unit/integration tests
npm run test:sidecar     # Run sidecar + API handler tests
npm run test:e2e         # Run all Playwright E2E tests
make generate            # Regenerate proto stubs + per-service & unified OpenAPI specs (requires buf + sebuf v0.11.1 plugins)
npm run worktree:bootstrap          # Fresh worktree: link local env files + npm ci with tmp cache
npm run worktree:bootstrap:test-only # Fresh docs/test worktree: same, but npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run worktree:env                # Link ignored local env files only
```

## Fresh Worktree Bootstrap

Worktrees usually start without ignored local state. When creating or entering one:

1. Start from `origin/main` or the requested base, not a dirty local branch.
2. Run `npm run worktree:bootstrap` before typecheck/tests. The helper links ignored `.env.local` / `.env` from the main worktree when Git can infer it, and installs deps with `npm ci --cache /tmp/worldmonitor-npm-cache`.
3. If only docs/test tooling is needed and native postinstall work is unnecessary, use `npm run worktree:bootstrap:test-only`.
4. If live credentials are unavailable, do not fabricate secrets. Run the non-credentialed checks you can and report the credential gate explicitly.

Env rules:

- Link only `.env.local` and `.env`. Never copy or link `.env.vercel-backup` or `.env.vercel-export`; the pre-push guard blocks those files even as symlinks.
- Override env source discovery with `WM_ENV_SOURCE=/path/to/worldmonitor npm run worktree:env` when the main worktree cannot be inferred.
- `.env*` files are ignored local state. Do not add, print, or summarize secret values.

Validation hygiene:

- Prefer `npm ci` over `npm install` in fresh worktrees. Use `npm_config_cache=/tmp/worldmonitor-npm-cache` for `npx` or install commands if cache ownership errors appear.
- After bootstrap or pre-push, run `git status --short`. If dependency bootstrap changed lockfiles you did not intend to edit, remove those incidental changes before finalizing.
- After install, prefer local tools such as `./node_modules/.bin/tsx --test ...` for focused TypeScript tests when `npx` is flaky.

## Architecture Rules

### Dependency Direction

```
types -> config -> services -> components -> app -> App.ts
```

- `types/` has zero internal imports
- `config/` imports only from `types/`
- `services/` imports from `types/` and `config/`
- `components/` imports from all above
- `app/` orchestrates components and services

### API Layer Constraints

- `api/*.js` are Vercel Edge Functions: **self-contained JS only**
- They CANNOT import from `../src/` or `../server/` (different runtime)
- Only same-directory `_*.js` helpers and npm packages
- Enforced by `tests/edge-functions.test.mjs` and pre-push hook esbuild check

### Server Layer

- `server/` code is bundled INTO Edge Functions at deploy time via gateway
- `server/_shared/` contains Redis client, rate limiting, LLM helpers
- `server/worldmonitor/<domain>/` has RPC handlers matching proto services
- All handlers use `cachedFetchJson()` for Redis caching with stampede protection

### Proto Contract Flow

```
proto/ definitions -> buf generate -> src/generated/{client,server}/ -> handlers wire up
```

- GET fields need `(sebuf.http.query)` annotation
- `repeated string` fields need `parseStringArray()` in handler
- `int64` maps to `string` in TypeScript
- CI checks proto freshness via `.github/workflows/proto-check.yml`

## Variant System

The app ships multiple variants with different panel/layer configurations:

- `full` (default): All features
- `tech`: Technology-focused subset
- `finance`: Financial markets focus
- `commodity`: Commodity markets focus
- `happy`: Positive news only
- `energy`: Energy security, chokepoints, oil/gas, and disruption timelines

Variant is set via `VITE_VARIANT` env var. Config lives in `src/config/variants/`.

## Key Patterns

### Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Define proto message in `proto/worldmonitor/<domain>/`
2. Add RPC with `(sebuf.http.config)` annotation
3. Run `make generate`
4. Create handler in `server/worldmonitor/<domain>/`
5. Wire handler in domain's `handler.ts`
6. Use `cachedFetchJson()` for caching, include request params in cache key

### Adding a New Panel

1. Create `src/components/MyPanel.ts` extending `Panel`
2. Register in `src/config/panels.ts`
3. Add to variant configs in `src/config/variants/`
4. Wire data loading in `src/app/data-loader.ts`

### Circuit Breakers

- `src/utils/circuit-breaker.ts` for client-side
- Used in data loaders to prevent cascade failures
- Separate breaker per data domain

### Caching

- Redis (Upstash) via `server/_shared/redis.ts`
- `cachedFetchJson()` coalesces concurrent cache misses
- Cache tiers: fast (5m), medium (10m), slow (30m), static (2h), daily (24h)
- Cache key MUST include request-varying params

## Testing

- **Unit/Integration**: `tests/*.test.{mjs,mts}` using `node:test` runner
- **Sidecar tests**: `api/*.test.mjs`, `src-tauri/sidecar/*.test.mjs`
- **E2E**: `e2e/*.spec.ts` using Playwright
- **Visual regression**: Golden screenshot comparison per variant

## CI Checks (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow | Trigger | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `typecheck.yml` | PR + push to main | `tsc --noEmit` for src and API |
| `lint.yml` | PR (markdown changes) | markdownlint-cli2 |
| `proto-check.yml` | PR (proto changes) | Generated code freshness |
| `build-desktop.yml` | Manual | Tauri desktop build |
| `test-linux-app.yml` | Manual | Linux AppImage smoke test |

## Pre-Push Hook

Runs automatically before `git push`. Two tiers:

**Always (state-dependent, fast — run even on a cache hit):** local Vercel env-dump guard, PR-state check (no pushes to merged/closed PR branches), branch-contamination guard (>20 commits ahead), `scripts/` lockfile sync.

**Tree-dependent (skipped entirely on a green-tree cache hit):** Unicode safety and version sync (always run for uncached trees), plus the diff-scoped checks: TypeScript (frontend tsc on `src/`-surface changes; `typecheck:api` on `api/|server/|scripts/|src/generated/`; Convex tsc on `convex/`), CJS syntax, boundary/safe-html/Sentry-coverage/rate-limit/premium-fetch lints (each also fires when its own guardrail script changes), edge esbuild check (`api/|server/|src/generated/` — edge entries bundle-import server code), markdown/MDX lint, proto + pro-test bundle freshness, change-scoped tests. `package.json`/`tsconfig` changes — or an unresolvable `origin/main` diff — force everything (an unresolvable diff also bypasses the green-tree cache: a blind run trusts nothing, including prior attestations).

**Green-tree cache:** a tree that passed the full gate is recorded (`$GIT_DIR/wm-prepush-green`); re-pushing the identical tree (remote failure, message-only amend) skips all tree-dependent checks — same tree, same result. Delete that file to force a full re-run.

Heavy checks (`test:data`, typechecks, edge-bundle) must run **sequentially** in worktrees — parallel runs OOM (exit 137).

## Shipping Velocity (Agent Workflow)

- **Before starting work on an issue:** check for parallel/duplicate work first — `gh pr list --search "<issue#>"` AND `git worktree list` (background codex/claude sessions ship PRs under the same account).
- **After pushing a PR:** don't sleep-poll CI. Enable auto-merge (`gh pr merge <n> --auto --squash` — repo has auto-merge enabled) and/or start `gh pr checks <n> --watch` as a background task; act only when it exits.
- **docs/plans/ is gitignored** — plan documents are local working state and do not travel between worktrees or ship in PRs.
- **PR-review verification:** never assert a finding is fixed/stale from memory — re-fetch the PR head SHA and diff the cited lines first.

## Deployment

- **Web**: Vercel (auto-deploy on push to main)
- **Relay/Seeds**: Railway (Docker, cron services)
- **Desktop**: Tauri builds via GitHub Actions
- **Docs**: Mintlify (proxied through Vercel at `/docs`)

## Critical Conventions

- `fetch.bind(globalThis)` is BANNED. Use `(...args) => globalThis.fetch(...args)` instead
- Edge Functions cannot use `node:http`, `node:https`, `node:zlib`
- Always include `User-Agent` header in server-side fetch calls
- Yahoo Finance requests must be staggered (150ms delays)
- New data sources MUST have bootstrap hydration wired in `api/bootstrap.js`
- Redis seed scripts MUST write `seed-meta:<key>` for health monitoring
